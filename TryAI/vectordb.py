Vector databases store data by using vector embeddings.
Vector embeddings in vector databases refer to a way of representing objects,
such as items, documents, or data points, as vectors in a multi-dimensional space.
Each object is assigned a vector that captures various characteristics or features of that object. 
These vectors are designed in such a way that similar objects have vectors that are closer
to each other in the vector space, while dissimilar objects have vectors that are farther apart.
