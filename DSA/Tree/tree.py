Non-Liner Data structure in which collction of elements known as nodes are connected to 
each other via such that there exists exactly one path between any two ndoes

A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used 
to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. 
It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 

The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. 
Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes,
 forming a recursive structure.

Terminologies In Tree Data Structure
Parent Node: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. {B} is the parent node of {D, E}.
Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. Examples: {D, E} are the child nodes of {B}.
Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node. 
    {A} is the root node of the tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path
    from the root to all other nodes of the tree.
Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. 
    {I, J, K, F, G, H} are the leaf nodes of the tree.
Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node. {A,B} are the ancestor nodes of the node {E}
Descendant: A node x is a descendant of another node y if and only if y is an ancestor of x.
Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings. {D,E} are called siblings.
Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0.
Internal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.
Neighbor of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node.
Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.
